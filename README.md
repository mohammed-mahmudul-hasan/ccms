<h4>1. Git</h4>
<p> I like to use git to upload code to GitHub. Firstly I wrote almost the full code offline and uploaded it to
     GitHub using git. But I also modified the code several times in the IDE and updated it in GitHub pushing the code
      using git.</p>
<h4>2. UML</h4>
<p>I've created some types of diagram for this project.</p>

<p>Use case diagram is a behavioral UML diagram type. This diagram is used to do analysis on many systems. These diagrams are useful to realize the different types of roles in a system and to detect how those roles interact with system. One of the purposes of a use case diagram is to identify functions and how roles interact with them. Use case diagram is important for a high level view of the system. Internal and external factors can be identified by this. I have created two use case models; one is for admin and the other one is for user(customer).</p>

</ul>
<p>Business Process Model is a very important tool to build a flowing diagram or model. It's a mapping concept. It defines actual flow of data. It is process of creating a structural view of a process or system.</p>

<p>The logical data model is used for reporting the database elements of a business sector. The entities and the relationships shared by them are the center elements of ER models. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a logical data model. ER diagram of my project can be seen from the provided link below.</p>

<h4>9. IDE</h4>
<p>I chose Android Studio as IDE for doing this project. Though I use Visual Studio Code most of the time to code
    and do small projects, I selected Android Studio as it is very convenient to do android projects. It's also easy
    to use git plugin inside android studio to push and pull code from GitHub.
