****** Clean Code Development Cheet Sheet *******

#1. Readability
    > Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and other elements.
    > Variable and method names should be readable so that someone can easily understand it.

Bad practice:
    String e;
    String p;
Good practice:
    String email;
    String password;

#2. Simplicity
    > Avoid complex logic.
    > Break down complex functions into smaller, simpler ones.
    > Remove dead code and redundant statements.

#3. Write functions or methods for in a well catagorised way so that they are easy to access to 
update code if necessary.

#4. Check the text format of user input is ok or not.

Bad practice:
email input => karim@@@ssg
Takes the input and no warning.
Good practice:
email input => karim@@@ssg
Displays warning for wrong format and force to input again.


#5. Long statement should be avoided. Short statement is good to write.

#6. When there is a library available, don't write your own code, use it.

#7. It's good to handle exception. So, It's good to use try{}, catch{}.

#8. Write TODO comments to indicate where there is something to be reworked.

#9. Blank spaces
    > Don't use unnecessary or multiple blank spaces.
    >  Use exactly one blank space before and after mathematical operators and one blank space after commas.
    > No blank space before a comma(,) or smicolon(;)

Bad practice:
a   =   1+2  ;
Good practice:
a = 1 + 2;

#10. Always check the mandatory fields of a form are filled by the user or not. Display warning.
